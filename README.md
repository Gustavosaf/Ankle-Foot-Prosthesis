# Ankle-Foot-Prosthesis
This project consists of developing a transtibial prosthesis with interaction on a mobile platform. The prosthesis is equipped with a keel that interacts with Elastic Foundation Force contact generated by the mobile platform.

Project Components:

Transtibial Prosthesis: The prosthetic footis has design based on ventureÂ® and is designed to provide support and mobility for individuals with transtibial amputations. It incorporates a mobile ankle.

Mobile Platform: The mobile platform is designed to simulate walking conditions and interaction with the surface during prosthesis use. The platform has one degree of freedom (GDL) and moves along the rotational z-axis.
